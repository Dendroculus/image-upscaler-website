        <p className="font-semibold text-slate-800 text-base">We respect your privacy.</p>
        <p>At Pixel Forge, we believe that your data is yours. Because this application processes images using cloud GPUs, here is exactly what happens to your files:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mt-2">
          <li><strong>Zero Storage:</strong> Uploaded images are securely temporarily stored in Azure Blob Storage solely for the duration of the upscaling process.</li>
          <li><strong>Instant Deletion:</strong> The moment the AI finishes processing and you download your result, your original image and the upscaled result are permanently deleted from our servers.</li>
          <li><strong>No Tracking:</strong> We do not use tracking cookies, we do not log your IP address to your uploads, and we do not use your images to train future AI models.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As this is an open-source project, you can view our exact backend code on GitHub to verify how your data is handled.</p>

        <p>By using Pixel Forge, you agree to the following terms:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mt-2">
          <li><strong>Acceptable Use:</strong> You may not upload illegal, explicit, or malicious content. The platform employs automated basic security checks to reject non-image file types.</li>
          <li><strong>Rate Limiting:</strong> This tool is provided free of charge. Please do not abuse the API or run automated batch scripts against the service, as it will exhaust our GPU credits.</li>
          <li><strong>No Warranty:</strong> The service is provided &quot;as is&quot; without any warranties. We are not responsible for any lost files, interruptions in service, or specific outcomes of the AI upscaling process.</li>
